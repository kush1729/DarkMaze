# DarkMaze

An original maze solving game. In this game, the user controls a robot, and tries to navigate a maze and avoid certain monsters in the maze. The catch is that the robot can only see a 5x5 section of the maze centered on him; hence the name Dark Maze. For more information you can look at the help menu when you run the game (by running main.py)

While this game is fully functional, more levels could be added using 'level_creator.py'. While it is an interactive program, minimal user-error handling has been implemented, so care must be taken while using this program. However, if more levels are added than can be accomodated in the current 'Levels Menu' window, a scroll bar will need to be added as well. 
More objects may also be defined (such as a door-key object pair, more monsters with different abilities, etc), but the corresponding updates will have to be made in the various module files.
