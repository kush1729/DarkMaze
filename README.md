# DarkMaze

An original maze solving game. In this game, the user controls a robot, and tries to navigate a maze and avoid certain monsters in the maze. The catch is that the robot can only see a 3x3 section of the maze centered on him; hence the name Dark Maze.

For more information you can look at the help menu when you run the game (by running main.py)
